        <p>I think this means we're starting a blog... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

        <p>Why you ask?  Well because I'm weird and a bit obtuse largely; but here are few other excuses I've come up with for this madness:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>It's nice to share stuff with people, but posting on instagram is a pain in the neck.  I'm sure this will be easier ;)</li>
            <li>I think blogs are way cooler than social media anyways.</li>
            <li>It turns out I kinda like coding, and this is largely an excuse to do that.</li>
            
        </ol>

        <p>So there you have it, my first and probably my last blog post.</p>
