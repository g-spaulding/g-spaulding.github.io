        <h2>The Skate Park So Far</h2>

        <h3 class="date">March 9, 2023</h3>

        <p>As soon as the floor of the barn was something resembling solid and level, it was time to start on something I'd been dreaming about for as long as I can remember - building a skatepark.</p>

        <p>Because the floor is still so rough, I've had to sheet not only the ramps themselves, but also the flat bottoms.  This meant step one was to frame out a level base to actually start building on.</p>

        <p>Considering I'd been dreaming this for so long, I didn't really do a very good job actually planning.  Version zero used all 7' transitions and had everything 5' tall.</p>

        <p>This 5' quarter + 3' sub-box turned out not to really give enough speed for the spine, so it has since been re-built as a 6 1/2' quarter and rides much better.</p>

        <p>This wallride is the only one of the original features that hasn't been modified yet.  It might get changed from a slant wall to a true vertical wall at some point, but it's working for now.</p>

        <p>Once the spine mini was working, we pretty quickly got bored going back and forth on the quarter/spine/wallride of phase 1, so I started expanding - phase 2.</p>

        <p>Phase 3 was to add a second hip going the other way.  There's a lot of space on this side, so everything had to be compressed down.  The hip landing is only about 2 1/2' high, and the vert wall is about 7' with a tight 5 1/2' transition.</p>
